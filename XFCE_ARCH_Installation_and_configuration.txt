sudo pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies

if you have a multimedia keyboard, go to terminal and enter command:
	pactl list sinks short
from whatever reason this activates my multimedia keys.

change panel to transparent "alpha"
use "pulseaudio" and "pavucontrol" packages for audio management (see "ARCH_Sound_control")

Don't forget to switch desktop enviroment in your desktop (login) manager (e.g. sddm)

To disable annoying "Keyring" popup dialog when opening e.g. a web browser uninstall gnome-keyring
	sudo pacman -Runs gnome-keyring
and then reboot.
