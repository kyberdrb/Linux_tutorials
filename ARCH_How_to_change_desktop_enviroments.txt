FROM "X" to "Y"

# Disable your desktop manager (I use sddm)
	sudo systemctl disable sddm.service
# Reboot
	sudo reboot
# Log in with your username and password
# Uninstall current desktop environment
	sudo pacman -Runs X
# Install new desktop environemt
	sudo pacman -S Y
# Turn on the desktop manager
	sudo systemctl enable sddm.service


NOTES

#1
If you don't have sddm, use your current desktop manager or install sddm via
	sudo pacman -S sddm

#2
It's always better to have only one desktop environment installed, beacuse although we only use one of them, the other ones can still consume ressources (e.g. uninstalling 'gnome-extra' reduces RAM usage from 500MB to 200MB for LXDE).
