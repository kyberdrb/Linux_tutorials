Here is what worked for me after I installed 12.04 last week.

The steps are these:

$ sudo gedit /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/50_unity-greeter.gschema.override
Add these lines:

[com.canonical.unity-greeter]
play-ready-sound = false
Save, then run:

$ sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
Reboot and enjoy. I apologize that I've misplaced the link to the page that provided this information; if I have time later I will try to find it and edit this answer.

Edit: Here is the link:

Edit2: Tested under Ubuntu 13.04. Still works fine !
