If we can' update Arch Linux with

  sudo pacman -Syu

then we probably have our boot partition mounted as "ro" - Read-Only.
It occurs when kernel or some kernel module is being added/removed/modified.
We need to remount it as "rw" - Read-Write.

First we need to find out, where is our partition mounted and how it's called

  lsblk

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot
├─sda2   8:2    0     4G  0 part [SWAP]
└─sda3   8:3    0   210G  0 part /
sr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom

In my case, the boot partition is called '/dev/sda1' and is mounted in '/boot' directory.
Now we can remount it as Read-Write

  sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /boot

Run pacman update again

  sudo pacman -Syu
  cd
  rm -rf ~/.libvirt

The update procedure will finish successfully.
