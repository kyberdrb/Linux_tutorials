Install required packages

  sudo pacman -S gvfs gvfs-mtp gvfs-gphoto2

Adjust XFCE settings

  Applications menu -> Settings -> Removable Drives and Media -> check " Mount removable drives when hot-plugged" and " Mount removable media when inserted"

Plug in your USB stick.
Open file manager.
You should see the USB stick mounted in the left column.


If not, you can still mount the drive manually via terminal:

Check, which label corresponds your USB stick

  lsblk
or
  sudo fdisk -l

Then mount it

  gvfs-mount -d /dev/sdX#

where X is the drive name and # is the partition number, e.g.

  gvfs-mount -d /dev/sdb1
