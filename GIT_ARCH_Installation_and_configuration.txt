How to install and configure git on Arch Linux

Install required packages (the second one is for large files >50MB)
sudo pacman -S git
yaourt -S git-lfs

I assume that you already have a GitHub account and a repository to work with.
After installation we need to configure a couple of things.
First we need to configure git. Go to your home directory and add this to the file ".gitconfig":

  [core] 
  packedGitLimit = 512m 
  packedGitWindowSize = 512m 
  [pack] 
  deltaCacheSize = 2047m 
  packSizeLimit = 2047m 
  windowMemory = 2047m

This should solve the "EOF" error.
When cloning a repository after the installation, git will ask for your name and email. You can provide it with given commands.
Then you need to configure git-lfs (Large File Storage). Git LFS is a subsystem of git, that allows us to have files >50MB as
a part of the repository. Configure Git LFS via these commands:
  git lfs install         # updates configuration of .gitconfig in home directory
  git lfs track "*.pdf"   # adds extension to track for LFS
  git add .gitattributes
  git commit -m "Updated gitattributes to pdfs"
  git push
  
Put the extension of large files between the quotation marks.
After that just push changes to your repository as you are used to.
 git add -A
 git commit -m "what has been changed / added / removed"
 git push

Also make sure you allow

  "collector.githubapp.com"
  "lfs.github.com"
  "api.github.com"
  
in your DNS (Pi-hole), otherwise you may end up with following error message
  Post https://lfs.github.com/kyberdrb/some_ridiculously_large_address: dial tcp 192.168.0.10:443: getsockopt: connection refused
