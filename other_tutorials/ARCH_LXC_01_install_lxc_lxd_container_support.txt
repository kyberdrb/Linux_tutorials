-Install required packages

  sudo pacman -S lxc arch-install-scripts dnsmasq debootstrap
  yaourt -S yum

Now you can manage priviledged LXC containers.
These can be managed only as root/sudo.


***************************
FOR ADDITIONAL LXD SUPPORT
***************************
Install

  yaourt -S yum lxd

Sub{u,g}id configuration
You will need sub{u,g}ids for root, so that LXD can create the unprivileged containers:

  echo "root:1000000:65536" | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid

Accessing LXD as a unprivileged user
By default the LXD daemon allows users in the lxd group access, so add your user to the group:

  sudo usermod -a -G lxd <user>

***************************


-Create LXC bridged interface with NAT to connect containers to the Internet

  sudo nano /etc/default/lxc-net

# Leave USE_LXC_BRIDGE as "true" if you want to use lxcbr0 for your
# containers.  Set to "false" if you'll use virbr0 or another existing
# bridge, or mavlan to your host's NIC.
USE_LXC_BRIDGE="true"

# If you change the LXC_BRIDGE to something other than lxcbr0, then
# you will also need to update your /etc/lxc/default.conf as well as the
# configuration (/var/lib/lxc/<container>/config) for any containers
# already created using the default config to reflect the new bridge
# name.
# If you have the dnsmasq daemon installed, you'll also have to update
# /etc/dnsmasq.d/lxc and restart the system wide dnsmasq daemon.
LXC_BRIDGE="lxcbr0"
LXC_ADDR="10.0.3.1"
LXC_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
LXC_NETWORK="10.0.3.0/24"
LXC_DHCP_RANGE="10.0.3.2,10.0.3.254"
LXC_DHCP_MAX="253"
# Uncomment the next line if you'd like to use a conf-file for the lxcbr0
# dnsmasq.  For instance, you can use 'dhcp-host=mail1,10.0.3.100' to have
# container 'mail1' always get ip address 10.0.3.100.
#LXC_DHCP_CONFILE=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf

# Uncomment the next line if you want lxcbr0's dnsmasq to resolve the .lxc
# domain.  You can then add "server=/lxc/10.0.3.1' (or your actual $LXC_ADDR)
# to your system dnsmasq configuration file (normally /etc/dnsmasq.conf,
# or /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/lxc.conf on systems that use NetworkManager).
# Once these changes are made, restart the lxc-net and network-manager services.
# 'container1.lxc' will then resolve on your host.
#LXC_DOMAIN="lxc"



Tip: Make sure the bridges ip-range does not interfere with your local network.

Then we need to modify the LXC container template so our containers use our bridge:

  sudo nano /etc/lxc/default.conf

lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
lxc.net.0.flags = up
lxc.net.0.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx



Then we can start the bridge:

  sudo systemctl start lxc-net

Enable it after startup (optional)

  sudo systemctl enable lxc-net

We can verify the newly created interafce by issuing a command

  ip a

The interface is shown in terminal.
It does show up int GNS3 for the cloud in the drop-down menu AFTER CHECKING THE "SHOW SPECIAL ETHERNET INTERFACES"!
