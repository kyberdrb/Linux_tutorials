Before enabling hibernation, please try to test whether it works correctly by running pm-hibernate in a terminal. The system will try to hibernate. If you are able to start the system again then you are more or less safe to add an override.

To do so, start editing:

sudo nano /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla
Fill it with this:

[Re-enable hibernate by default]
Identity=unix-user:*
Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate
ResultActive=yes

Save by pressing Ctrl-O then enter and then exit nano by pressing Ctrl-X.

Restart and hibernation is back!

Or run

  killall unity-panel-service

to just reset the menu.

Some users will then need to run
  sudo update-grub
to get the hibernate option to be available in the power menu..
