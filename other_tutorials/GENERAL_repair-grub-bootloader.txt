Problem:
The computer fails to start and shows following message:
  "Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key"

Install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu

Boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB.
Choose "Try Ubuntu"
Connect internet
Open a new Terminal and type:
  sudo -i
  add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update
  apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair

It will open the "Boot-Repair" main window.
Click on "Recommended repair".
Wait.

You may have been prompted with a dialog to uninstall grub bootloader manually;
If that happens, a series of commands will be displayed to remove the 
existing grub bootloader (you will see something similar to this
'http://sourcedigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/boot-repair-2.jpg').

Open a new terminal windows and type (last command is a bit modified):
  sudo -i
  chroot "/mnt" dpkg --configure -a
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get install -fy
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub grub2 grub-common grub2-common grub-common:i386

if the last command doesn't work, try executing it by parts:
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub2
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub-common
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub2-common
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub-common:i386
  
And then press "Forward" button in the Boot-Repair window.
Boot-Repair will then prompt you again with another command, which will install your 
bootloader. This part may be different if you use BIOS or UEFI
  sudo -i
  chroot "/mnt" apt-get install -y grub-efi-amd64

After the command finishes, press "Forward" in Boot-Repair window.
When prompted to generate Bootinfo report, confirm!
After that it will show another windows with the link to the BootInfo report and
with a message that the grub bootloader was successfuly repaired.
You can open the link on another computer or send it to your mail for further inspection.

This is a sample of such report:

Close that window and reboot your computer. Dont' forget to remove the USB drive.

The system should now recognize the grub bootloader on it.
