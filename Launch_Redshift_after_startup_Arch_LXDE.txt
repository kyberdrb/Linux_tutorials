sudo pacman -S python-xdg python-gobject librsvg

Go to LXDE menu -> Preferences -> Desktop session preferences and make sure
that Redshift is enabled after startup

Then go to LXDE menu -> Run and run:
    "redshift-gtk"
    
This should show the icon in the system tray. If it doesn't show the icon,
launch "redshift-gtk" via terminal and check the output and install required
packages (use google if necessary).

After the icon appears, right click on it and check the box "Autostart".
Reboot.

Redshift should now start after logging in.
