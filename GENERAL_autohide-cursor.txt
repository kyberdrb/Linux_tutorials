this is a way how to hide cursor after 5 seconds of inactivity in Ubuntu. Cursor may be unnecessary for example in youtube player in fullscreen mode.

First of all install Unclutter

sudo apt-get install unclutter

then run unclutter. type in terminal

unclutter

thats it! you get rid of the cursor in 1 second.
if this is too short time delay you can extend it
run
sudo gedit /etc/default/unclutter

change the line
EXTRA_OPTS="-idle 1 -root"

to
EXTRA_OPTS="-idle 5 -root"

save file
reboot
