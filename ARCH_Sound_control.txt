Beacuse the default Volume Control app in LXDE doesn't always behave correctly,
we need to bypass it somehow.

Hardware
I have a TV with speakers connected to PC via HDMI and headset connected to audio jacks
on the motherboard. Sound works, but I can't switch audio inputs nor outputs via the
integrated LXDE Volume Control utility.

Solution
Install these packages:
  sudo pacman -S pulseaudio pavucontrol

Right click on the "speaker" icon in the system tray -> "Volume Control" settings
Set "Command to Open Mixer" to pavucontrol

Right click on the "speaker" icon in the system tray -> Volume mixer
That opens Volume Control (pavucontrol).
On the "Playback" you can control, which application outputs sound to witch sound device.

"Output device" tab seems to be broken: changing default devices didn't work.



Alternatively, you can install sound management from GNOME:

sudo pacman -S gnome-shell gnome-control-center

Run it from the terminal using command "gnome-control-center". Then navigate to "Sound" category.


For Bluetooth support you can install GNOME bluetooth modules:

sudo pacman -S gnome-bluetooth
